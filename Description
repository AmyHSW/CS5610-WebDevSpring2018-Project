Description
1.	Problem Statement
Nowadays, more and more people will evaluate the product on internet before shopping. And it is needed to have a website which could show reviews of products to the customers. As we can see in amazon, millions of people post and view the reviews of the products every day. So we want to build a website which has the similar function with amazon’s review system. But more, we add social interaction for users because we allow them to follow other users. 

2.	Proposed Solution
We have completed a website for the above problems.  This is a platform for online shoppers’ to share their own reviews for products, and view others’ reviews. In our main page, users can search products using key words, and the result will show all products containing key words ordered by these products’ rating. So that users can view the top-rated products they are interested in easily. Our homepage also provides recommended products for users. Users can have their followers and following lists, which will provide social interaction for them. Finally, we also set the “Business User” role who can post new product.

3.	Potential Users
Our website targets the users who are used to search the products and reviews on Internet before shopping. And also, it is a good platform for the people who are eager to be influential by providing high quality reviews for products.

4.	Domain Object
Our project contains three domain objects: User, Product, Review.

User: User model contains personal information about users. We use type to differentiate user’s role. We allow every user to upload an image as their profile picture. Also, we have follower List, following list and favorite list for users.
 

Product: Product has foreign key to user. It contains information about a product like product name, brand, price. And we allow user to upload one image for a product.
 

Review: Review has foreign key to user and product. It contains summery rating and content.
 


5.	User role
We have four roles in platform: admin, business user, reviewer, observer.

Admin: Admin is the administrator of the website, they can manage the other users’ information which includes their followings and reviews. Admin can delete other users. 

Business User: Business User is the provider of the products, they could post and edit their products and related information to the website. But they cannot add reviews to the products. They could only see other’s reviews.

Reviewer: Most users should choose reviewer as role. They could post the new reviews, view the reviews and follow other reviewers. They could also view their own review history. 
Observer:  Observers can view the other’s reviews, but they could not create new reviews. They can save products to their favorites list.
